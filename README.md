This is a kaggle dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhirensk/cats-vs-dogs-training8000test2000

what we did was to apply convolutional neural networks to classify cats and dogs. Results at the beggining where not impressive and had overfitting but with some work, they became quite good 
with an accuracy score in the validation set of 0.8
